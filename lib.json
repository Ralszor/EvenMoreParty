        //"wrap" makes all attackBoxes wrap per 3 party members. i.e; Kris, Susie, Ralsei. Noelle would be layered under Kris, and Berdly under Susie.
        //"oneLane" stacks all boxes onto Kris. Basically a multibar attack on steroids.
        //"expanded" makes a new UIBox and puts everyone in line, basically how FiraRain's MoreParty did it without squishing.
